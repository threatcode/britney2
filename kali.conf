# This option makes it easier for Britney to handle transitions as she

# This requires that your archive tool is capable of handling binaries
# without a source (or multiple versions of the source package in a
# given suite).  The "old" source will *not* be listed in the output
# for binaries that are retained like this.  DAK is known to handle
# this and will keep the "old" source in the target distribution as
