# In this file you can put hints to convince britney to migrate some
# packages even though it might break some other packages, such hints
# look like this:
# force-hint perl/5.20.0-4

# Easy hints do not break anything but might also fail, they should
# contain a combination of packages that should migrate together:
# easy syslog-ng/3.5.6-2 syslog-ng-incubator/0.3.3-2
